   - Use strong device passwords

4. **Network Security**
   - Use secure networks when possible
   - Consider VPN for sensitive operations
   - Monitor for unusual activity

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries

2. **Authentication**
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure authentication methods
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits
